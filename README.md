# SparkFun_Ambient_Sensor_VEML6030
The SparkFun Ambient Light Sensor - VEML6030 (Qwiic) is an I2C enabled ambient light sensor with high sensitivity and high accuracy. 

I've taken the Arduino version and adapted it to work on a Linux platform.  (Basically a Raspberry Pi, but it should work on any Linux).
Hope someone else finds it useful.
